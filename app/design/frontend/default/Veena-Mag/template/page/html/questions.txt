Doubts

Bootstrap being used in header.html - done
How it causes responsive.css and custom.css to be made simple

1. What are quick lists
2. Delivery code - how does it get fetched
3. All this commenting of nav-responsiv - was it originally there in MAG091071
4. Do you think gettting a login for Loyalcity might work
5. What is megnor and why are custom.css and responsive.css in that subdirectory
6. How do I understand what table is getting read when displaying a particular field. As of now I do a find in files using notepad

The menu being responsive :-

The menupopup and all that is very well managed when the screen size is big. What exactly was supposed to happen in mag091017

1. Based on #nav, #nav-mobile and class advanced-nav in top.html what exactly is supposed to be displayed when the menu is contracted
 and how are the styles managed. 

 Compare menu_displayed.txt and inspect element output for $_menu and the difference.
2. How does nav_mobile get attached instead of the #nav
3. When I uncoment the responsive-menu lines the menu is displayed twice . Also $_menu is displayed without any styling when sandwich logo is clicked
